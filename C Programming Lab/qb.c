Design a flow chart and write an interactive program for the problem given below:

Assume that the United States of America uses the following income tax code formula for their annual income:
First US$ 5000 of income : 0% tax
Next US$ 10,000 of income: 10% tax
Next US$ 20,000 of income : 15% tax
An amount above US$ 35,000 : 20% tax.

For example, somebody earning US$ 38,000 annually would owe : 
US$ 5000 X 0.00 + 10,000 X 0.10 + 20,000 X 0.15 + 3,000 X 0.20, 
which comes to US$ 4600. 

Write a program that uses a loop to input the income and calculate and report 
the owed tax amount. 
Make sure that your calculation is mathematically accurate and that truncation errors are eliminated.
